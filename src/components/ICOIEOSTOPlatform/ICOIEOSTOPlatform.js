                                                <p>In terms of blockchain, ICO or Initial Coin Offering, is the primary aspect of crowdfunding. Starting in 2017, startups decided to leverage ICO to sidestep the rules to be followed by the initial investment process. To start an ICO, you only need the website as well as the wallet address to receive the money. The lack of legal boundaries, the lack of investor protection, the complete anonymity, and the lack of MVP are all common complaints. ICOs work in the same way as crowdfunding campaigns. In an ICO, the organizer will offer tokens, which will be traded for cryptocurrency by investors. For projects, tokens serve as their internal currency. Holders would, for instance, be able to use certain features of the platform.</p>

                                            <h3 class="gradient-text-blue">Liquidity:</h3>
                                            <p className="text-white">Investing in new options is deterred by a lack of liquidity, which is a common deterrent. In many cases, capital cannot be obtained for several years. The secondary market of an ICO allows for real-time pricing that is based around the current value of the project, in addition to high liquidity for investors.</p>
                                            <h3 class="gradient-text-blue">Decentralization:</h3>
                                            <p className="text-white">Everyone can participate in ICOs, especially if they accept cryptocurrencies. Most ICOs only require that contributors can transfer funds in time to purchase.</p>
                                            <h3 class="gradient-text-blue">Transparency:</h3>
                                            <p className="text-white">Investors can invest in ICOs at any time, and they are open to anyone. Unless you have a close relationship with one of the founders, it is difficult to become an early investor in traditional models of startup funding.</p>

                                                <p>IEOs share many characteristics with ICOs; however, they are conducted entirely on a trading platform. As a result, the platform is also in charge of managing the smart contract if applicable, performing the KYC, which is a part of the marketing, and allowing the token to be available on a secondary market instantly after the initial issue is complete. It is not uncommon for IEOs to take place on platforms operated by currency exchange platforms acting on behalf of the startup. Token issuers are required to pay a listing fee along with a portion of the tokens they sell during IEO since the entire process happens on the exchange platform. As a result, exchange platforms provide a higher level of credibility and reliability than ICOs. </p>

                                            <h3 class="gradient-text-blue">The exchange platform provides the following support:</h3>
                                            <p className="text-white">When businesses launch IEOs vs STOs, they join forces with exchange platforms to facilitate crowdfunding.</p>
                                            <p className="text-white"> In addition to listing, marketing, and smart contracts, the exchange will also assist with other aspects of the project. Investors interested in participating in the IEO need to create an account on the exchange and then purchase tokens at the IEO. Businesses can benefit from the exchange platforms and dramatically reduce their fundraising campaign costs as a result. Additionally, projects benefit from the credibility and existing user base of such exchanges. Users and fees benefit exchanges. We're all winners here.</p>
                                            <h3 class="gradient-text-blue">ROI: A significant return on investment</h3>
                                            <p className="text-white">When businesses choose an IEO as their fundraising strategy, they are going to have to put up a large amount of money at first. On the other hand, they may see a great return on investment in the long run. There are also benefits to exchanges as a result of the partnership. Their fees are typically flat or percentage-based, they get token fees, and they engage in profitable marketing collaborations.</p>
                                            <h3 class="gradient-text-blue">Integrity and trust:</h3>
                                            <p className="text-white">Large exchanges choose not to conduct IEOs because they cannot control projects enough to ensure that they deliver the products described in their whitepaper or prospectus. When investors who participate in an IEO suffer great losses, the exchange's reputation is severely damaged. Getting listed thus makes the exchange more credible. A project's listing on an exchange means a lot.</p>

                                                <p>Using a Security Token Offering, startups can raise capital by selling tokens that act like traditional securities. Security and transparency are the main benefits of STOs. The tokens first need to be issued in accordance with all securities regulations. Furthermore, the tokens must be issued on the blockchain. Because of this, STO tokens can only be issued once there's an infrastructure in place to support them. KYC and AML are just two of the rules that need to be adhered to by platforms that manage security tokens. Trading commodities on platforms such as these also requires licenses and regulation. From marketing to KYC/AML, security token projects must follow local regulations in order to sell security tokens.</p>

                                            <h3 class="gradient-text-blue">Costs are lower than IPOs:</h3>
                                            <p className="text-white">An organization that wants to go public has to invest a lot of money upfront. Because of this, only a few companies provide that service outside of the crypto world. Consequently, relatively few companies' shares can be purchased by investors. Securities token offerings are more cost-effective. Due to the elimination of all middlemen like brokers, exchange fees, and due diligence activities, STOs tend to be cheaper to operate. Furthermore, more STOs will increase the chances of investors purchasing assets.</p>
                                            <h3 class="gradient-text-blue">Flexibility:</h3>
                                            <p className="text-white">The process of listing a business is complicated. There are usually both initial and ongoing compliance checks involved. Many of these issues force business owners to run their businesses in a way that is not in line with their ideals. This makes them dependent on analyst recommendations and tied to a single exchange. Because of this, they may be unable to focus on their long-term vision rather than being driven into quarterly cycles. </p>
                                            <h3 class="gradient-text-blue">Accessibility around the world:</h3>
                                            <p className="text-white">All regions of the world have uniform standards for tokens, which makes buying and selling tokens very easy. Investors can buy and sell tokens in any country they choose. It can be tedious and costly to trade privately held shares, which are less liquid than security tokens.</p>
