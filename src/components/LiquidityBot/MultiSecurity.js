            <BorderedDescription>Security is the most important concept in crypto trading and our exchange was designed with sophisticated safety measures as almost all tokens and coins are held in cold storage. Cold wallets are highly secure hardware wallets that are not connected to the internet. Programmed algorithms regularly transfer client funds into cold storages thus providing the necessary level of safety.
