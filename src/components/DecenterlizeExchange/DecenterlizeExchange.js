               <p>The stream of centralized exchange platforms introduced both major crypto awareness as well as significant security challenges.</p>
               <p>We all remember too well the wave of crypto exchange hacks that shook the Blockchain community and showed that safekeeping of any assets, crypto included, is a responsible and challenging task. One too many exchanges went down due to an external or internal hack, with attackers making it off with a significant portion of exchange funds.</p>

                           <p>A decentralized exchange (DEX) is an online peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchange service which operates without central authority responsible for the asset storage and swapping. This service allows quick and easy cryptocurrency transactions between two interested parties without unnecessary movement of crypto funds with attached fees and complete anonymity.</p>

                           <p>It is impossible to manipulate crypto asset prices since supply is always tied to the demand and backed by the pair of cryptocurrencies.</p>

                           <p>It is impossible to counterfeit trading volumes with wash trading since all transaction information is on the public ledger. Besides, there is simply no central authority that would be interested in faking the trading volumes.</p>

                           <p>Since it's a peer-to-peer service, there is no need for identity checks (KYC), and any local authorities do not bound the decentralized exchange. The consent and responsibility to commence trading between two individuals are theirs alone.</p>

Cold wallets are highly secure hardware wallets that are not connected to the internet. Programmed algorithms regularly transfer client funds into cold storages thus providing the necessary level of safety.</p>
