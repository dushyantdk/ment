                            <p>Digital banking as a service has been adopted dozens of years ago and brought considerable convenience for both financial institutions and their customers.</p>
                            <p>While bank customers save their precious time with banking on-the-go, financial institutions can save on physical infrastructure and hiring costs by digitizing significant parts of their customer service operations. The recently emerged social distancing requirements have saturated the necessity of providing qualified banking services to customers entirely remotely.</p>
                            <p>Digital banking has opened up new marketing opportunities, revenue sources, and service channels for financial institutions.</p>
                            <p>As the first defense line, we ensure strong customer authentication combined with robust risk management in an ideal balance between a user-friendly and secure online experience.</p>
