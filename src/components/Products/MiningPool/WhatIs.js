                              <p className="mb-5"><span class="circle-white"></span>While mining pools are desirable to the average miner as they smooth out rewards and make them more predictable, they unfortunately concentrate power to the mining poolâ€™s owner.</p>
                              <p className="mb-5"><span class="circle-white"></span>Miners can, however, choose to redirect their hashing power to a different mining pool at anytime.</p>
                              <p className="mb-5"><span class="circle-white"></span>Due to the constraints of solo mining, the mining sector has devised a method of combining the hash power of individual miners to boost the probability of finding new blocks. This solution is what we call a mining pool. Think of it as a coordinated network of individual miners that have agreed to pool their computing power to generate output levels similar to those associated with large farms or even exceed them. </p>
